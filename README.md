# Walsh Code Club
This is the New Walsh Code Club site.
Help us out if you want to! Here's how:

If you are not a collaborator, fork to edit. This will make it easier to test your own edits as well, because you can push to gh-pages without any worries. If you are a collaborator, and you want to make a change, **always change the option from "Commit directly to..." to "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".** If this is a large change and you have permission to accept your own changes, please don't, but if it is fixing a typo, go ahead. But please don't forget to make a pull request instead. Also, if it is a big change, change the name of the branch from "*username*-patch-1" to smething more creative. Please. Otherwise, make it "*username*-weelilchange" or leave it as is.

Or check out a preview of this website here: http://tymmc2.github.io/CodeClubWalsh/

Or... just sit there.

An alternative is to look around our code!

Or.... just sit there.... longer....
